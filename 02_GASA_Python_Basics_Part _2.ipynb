    "Loops are code that repeats until a condition is met. Then, the code stops, and the result is output as a variable of some sort.  There are two types of loops a ***for*** loop and a ***while*** loop.  Good explanations with examples are given here:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-for-loop-and-while-loop-in-programming/   , and <br>\n",

Do something for each block and stop.  These are always finite and will terminate unless you have made a coding error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ***while*** loop keeps running until a condition is met. Check and ensure there is a final condition and it is finite, or the loop will run forever.    A final condition is, normally, a specific value or number of iterations.\n",
