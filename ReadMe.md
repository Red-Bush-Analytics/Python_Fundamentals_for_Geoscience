# Python Fundamentals for Geoscience
## Welcome
Welcome to the Python Fundamentals for Geoscience repository!

This repository is being developed to provide learning materials and tools tailored for data analytics in the geosciences. While there is a wealth of public resources focused on financial services and sales analytics, there is comparatively little available that addresses the specific needs of scientists and engineers.

This project is my attempt to bridge that gap—helping newcomers get started with Python and illustrating how both traditional and modern data analysis techniques can be implemented in a geoscience context.

## Structure
The scripts included here are drawn from my own project work and the courses I teach. I've broken them down into manageable chunks to make them easier to understand and adapt.

Each lesson or demonstration typically includes:

- A brief overview of the core theory,

- Several practical use cases,

- A set of exercises for hands-on practice,

- References for further reading,

- Occasional “Rabbit Holes” to explore deeper or tangential topics that go beyond the scope of the main lesson (each with at least one starting reference).

To make the content accessible to beginners and those without a coding background, the materials are provided in Jupyter Notebooks. I've aimed to keep the code as simple and readable as possible.

There is no single "correct" way to solve a problem in Python—different approaches and coding styles can achieve the same result. I encourage you to explore alternatives, ask colleagues, and experiment to find what works best for you. While this repository uses JupyterLab/Notebook, you're welcome to use any IDE or code editor that suits your workflow.
