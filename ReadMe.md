# Python Fundamentals for Geoscience

## Welcome

Hi and Welcome to the Python Fundamantals for Geoscience Repository. <br> This Repository is being constructed to make available learning materials and tools for data analytics comonly found in the geoscientists toolbox. There is a lot of information and exapmples for te financial services and sales analytics.  However, there is very little available in the public domain for scientists and engineers.<br>
This is my attempt to help people get started with coding in Python and show some of they ways in which both old and new methjods of data analysis can be set up using Python.

## Structure
The scripts in this repository are from my own work on projects or for courses that I teach.  I have tried to break them down into managable chunks of code.<br>
The current plan is to structure each lesson or demonstration into basic theory, demontrate several use casees, suggest a set of exercises to practice the methods and  provide references for further information.  For some Rabbit Holes for you to go down to chase interesting subjects that require more explanation than is needed for the demonstration. There will be at least one reference to start your exlporation.<br>
Because I want to make the information avaiable to beginners and people who are not experieced coders I have used the JupyterLab/JupyterNotebook format. I have tried to keep the code as simple as possible. There are many ways to approach a problem and write code to carry out a calcuation so search around, ask your colleagues who use Python and try various options to fins dout what works for you. Other IDE's and code editors have differs requirements and you may want to use a differet one dependig on your needs.
